Joseph Weisenbaum (creator of Eliza) ended up devoting most of the rest of his life to fighting AI. His biggest concern was that "if the computer says 'I understand' and there is no one there then it is a lie. And I can't imagine that people who are emotionally imbalanced could be effectively treated by systematic lying."

Crossing a line and becoming __Mindful__.

##Turing
- 1950 
- Can machine think?
- Turing's answer to that is "looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, its a duck."
- Turing's threshold was 30% for success in the turing test

##Loebner prize
- Annual turing test competition
- Judges on table at left
- Servers in middle
- "Confederates" are the real people that take the test. The stand behind a curtain.
- A few years ago computer fooled 25% of the judges. 1 vote away from turing's idea of success.

##Furby 

Discomfort holding Furby upside down

- Kids the age of reason (7 - 8)
- A furby, barbie, gerbie (gerbal)
- How long can you hold it upside down without feeling uncomfortable
- Kids can hold barbies upside down until there arms get tired (5+ minutes).
- Kids turned gerbie over in less than a (tortured) 8 seconds.
- Furby was turned over in about a minute. Kids felt guilty and confused. Two thoughts at once: its a toy; its helpless.

##AI
To simulate life a computer has to:

- Feel and show emotions
- Be aware of themselves and their environment
- Change over time <-- furby's develop the ability to talk over time

Miming fear isn't being fear but to an extent it is. Its just a level of complexity (think chemical reactions in neurons).

If love is simulated well enough (by a computer) it is something like love.

##Singularity

Martine Rothblatt got Hansen Robotics to build his wife Bina

Bina actually sucked... but to some degree it was absolutely profound.

These things don't actually have to be that good. Eliza was 100 lines of code and people poured their hearts into her. Play to ego needs and desire.
